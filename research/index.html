                <h3>Thin films</h3>
                <p>Thin films are grown using various methods, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), and sputtering. CVD involves the chemical reaction of gaseous precursors to form a solid film on a substrate, allowing for high-quality coatings with uniform thickness. ALD provides precise control over film thickness by depositing atomic layers one at a time, making it suitable for nanoscale applications. Sputtering uses energetic particles to eject material from a target, which then deposits as a thin film on a substrate. These techniques enable the production of thin films with tailored properties for applications in electronics, optics, and coatings.</p>

                <h3>Device fabrications</h3>
                <p>In neuromorphic devices, the focus is on creating hardware that simulates the functions of biological neural networks. This involves using materials like memristors and transistors to replicate synaptic and neuronal behavior. Key techniques include thin-film deposition and lithography, which enable the construction of nanoscale components that facilitate efficient information processing and learning, crucial for advancing artificial intelligence and brain-inspired computing.</p>

                <h3>2D materials</h3>
                <p>Two-dimensional layered materials, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), consist of atomically thin sheets. Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, characterized by high electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, and thermal conductivity. In contrast, TMDs are composed of transition metals and chalcogens, featuring distinct electronic properties, including tunable band gaps that can shift from indirect to direct depending on their thickness. These fundamental differences make graphene ideal for applications requiring conductivity, while TMDs are versatile for optoelectronic devices and semiconductor technologies.</p>

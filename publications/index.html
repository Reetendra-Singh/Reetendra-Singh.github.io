Atomic Layer Deposition of Crystalline β-NiS for Superior Sensing in Thin-Film Non-Enzymatic Electrochemical Glucose Sensors. <button class="abstract-btn" onclick="toggleAbstract('abstract1')">Abstract</button><div class="abstract-box" id="abstract1"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Rhombohedral nickel sulfide thin films were deposited on c-sapphire substrate via the atomic layer deposition (ALD) method using nickel acetylacetonate [Ni(acac)<sub>2</sub>] as nickel and H<sub>2</sub>S gas as sulfur precursors. The self-limiting nature of the ALD process is obtained in the temperature range of 200–240 °C, which provides crystalline NiS thin films without further annealing. A growth rate of ∼0.2 Å/cycle was observed at 200 °C. As-deposited thin films were studied for non-enzymatic electrochemical glucose sensing. The films exhibit an excellent sensitivity of 5.78 μA mM<sup>–1</sup>cm<sup>–2</sup> and a low detection limit of 0.052 μM with a very small response time of <2s.</div></p>

An Experimental Study of Carbon-Doped GaN via Solid-Gas Reaction Route and Investigation of Its Defect-Related Luminescence. <button class="abstract-btn" onclick="toggleAbstract('abstract2')">Abstract</button><div class="abstract-box" id="abstract2"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Carbon-doped gallium nitride (GaN) is a very interesting material with applications in optoelectronic devices, and studies related to their defects offer insights regarding possible transitions based on the nature of the defects. A simple solid–gas reaction route has yielded carbon-doped GaN. An isolated CN defect state has been observed by spectroscopic tools (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) along with the C<sub>N</sub>–O<sub>N</sub> complex formation. In addition to the red shift in the fundamental absorption band, a transition band was observed at ∼3.05 eV. A complete quenching of blue luminescence (BL) related to an oxygen defect and the appearance of a carbon-related yellow luminescence (YL) is shown in strongly doped samples. The origin of this defect-related YL in C-doped GaN is attributed to the carbon-defect C<sub>N</sub> (−1 charged) level transitions confirmed by absorption energy, photoluminescence (PL) peak position, and zero-phonon lines.</div></p>

Dependence of the Properties of 2D Nanocomposites Generated by Covalent Crosslinking of Nanosheets on the Interlayer Separation: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study. <button class="abstract-btn" onclick="toggleAbstract('abstract3')">Abstract</button><div class="abstract-box" id="abstract3"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Covalently cross-linked heterostructures of 2D materials are a new class of materials which possess electrochemical and photochemical hydrogen evolution properties. It was of considerable interest to investigate the role of interlayer spacing in the nanocomposites involving MoS<sub>2</sub> and graphene sheets and its control over electronic structures and catalytic properties. We have investigated this problem with emphasis on the hydrogen evolution properties of these structures by a combined experimental and theoretical study. We have linked MoS<sub>2</sub> based nanocomposites with other 2D materials with varying interlayer spacing by changing the linker and studied their hydrogen evolution properties. The hydrogen evolution activity for these composites decreases with increasing linker length, which we can link to a decrease in magnitude of charge transfer across the layers with increasing interlayer spacing. Factors such as the nature of the sheets, interlayer distance as well as the nature of the linker provide pathways to tune the properties of covalently cross-linked 2D material rendering this new class of materials highly interesting.</div></p>

A new precursor route for the growth of NbO<sub>2</sub> thin films by chemical vapor deposition. <button class="abstract-btn" onclick="toggleAbstract('abstract4')">Abstract</button><div class="abstract-box" id="abstract4"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Niobium dioxide (NbO<sub>2</sub>) exhibits metal-insulator transition (Mott transition) and shows the potential for application in memristors and neuromorphic devices. Presently growth of NbO<sub>2</sub> thin films requires high-temperature reduction of Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> films using H<sub>2</sub> or sophisticated techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy and pulsed laser deposition. The present study demonstrates a simple chemical route of the direct growth of crystalline NbO<sub>2</sub> films by chemical vapor deposition using a freshly prepared Nb-hexadecylamine (Nb-HDA) complex. X-ray diffraction studies confirm the NbO<sub>2</sub> phase with a distorted rutile body-centered-tetragonal structure and the film grown with a highly preferred orientation on c-sapphire. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the +4 oxidation state. The present method offers facile growth of NbO<sub>2</sub> films without post-reduction steps which will be assumed to be a cost-effective process for NbO<sub>2</sub> based devices.</div></p>

Metal–Insulator Transitions in Stable V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> Thin Films: Atomic Layer Deposition and Postdeposition Annealing Studies. <button class="abstract-btn" onclick="toggleAbstract('abstract5')">Abstract</button><div class="abstract-box" id="abstract5"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> New, stable V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> thin films are prepared using VO(acac)<sub>2</sub> and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and a post-treatment process on a c-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> substrate. The obtained V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> thin films are crystalline, and have single-phase and rhombohedral structure. The present ALD process yields a thickness of 48 nm by 1000 ALD cycles at a temperature of 200 °C; it portrays uniformity on planar sapphire substrates. The V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> films (48 nm) exhibit a sharp metal–insulator transition (MIT) at a temperature of ≈165 K with five orders of magnitude change in electrical resistivity.</div></p>

Hydrogen Generation by Solar Water Splitting Using 2D Nanomaterials. <button class="abstract-btn" onclick="toggleAbstract('abstract6')">Abstract</button><div class="abstract-box" id="abstract6"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Hydrogen is clearly the most environment-friendly alternative energy source available to us. The best way to produce hydrogen is to make use of the abundantly available solar power. This process is most beneficial both from energy and environmental aspects. A considerable effort is made to generate hydrogen by splitting water using a variety of inorganic catalysts, of which 2D materials are notable. Herein, a brief review of photocatalytic water splitting carried out using a variety of 2D catalysts is presented, including transition metal dichalcogenides, carbon nitride, heterostructures, and covalently cross-linked 2D composites.</div></p>

Superlattices of Covalently Cross-linked 2D Materials for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction. <button class="abstract-btn" onclick="toggleAbstract('abstract7')">Abstract</button><div class="abstract-box" id="abstract7"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Amongst the recent developments in 2D materials, van der Waals heterostructures formed by depositing a monolayer or few-layers of a 2D material on a monolayer or on few-layers of the same or another 2D material have attracted great attention. As an alternative to such heterostructures, we have carried out investigations on covalently cross-linked heterostructures by chemical coupling of layers of the same or different 2D materials. This effort has met with success, with typical systems studied by us being graphene–graphene, graphene–MoS<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>–MoS<sub>2</sub>, borocarbonitride–MoS<sub>2</sub>, and phosphorene–MoS<sub>2</sub>. We describe these structures to demonstrate how the covalent cross-linking strategy yields novel 2D nanocomposites. These structures exhibit interesting gas adsorption properties as well as noteworthy hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. The phosphorene–MoS<sub>2</sub> nanocomposite is found to exhibit superior photocatalytic HER activity. The most interesting nanocomposite is BCN–MoS<sub>2</sub> which exhibits electrochemical HER activity comparable to platinum, thus providing a new and novel example of metal-free catalysis.</div></p>

Remarkable Photochemical HER Activity of Semiconducting 2H MoSe<sub>2</sub> and MoS<sub>2</sub> Covalently Linked to Layers of 2D Structures and of the Stable Metallic 1T Phases Prepared Solvo- or Hydrothermally. <button class="abstract-btn" onclick="toggleAbstract('abstract8')">Abstract</button><div class="abstract-box" id="abstract8"> <strong>Abstract:</strong>  MoS<sub>2</sub> and MoSe<sub>2</sub>  in the stable semiconducting 2H form show negligible photocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By linking the layers of the dichalcogenide with layers of other 2D materials such as carbon-rich borocarbonitride (BC<sub>7</sub>N), one can enhance the photochemical HER activity significantly. Interestingly, such nanocomposites,MoSe<sub>2</sub>-Mose<sub>2</sub> and MoSe<sub>2</sub>–BCN show high photocatalytic activity even though the dichalcogenide itself is in the 2H form. This study shows the important role played by covalent cross-linking of layered compounds. Photocatalytic activity of covalently cross-linked layer of 2H-MoSe<sub>2</sub> is higher than that of 2H-MoS<sub>2</sub>. Unlike the 2H forms, the metallic 1T forms of MoS<sub>2</sub> and MoSe<sub>2</sub>  prepared by lithium intercalation followed by exfoliation, exhibit high photocatalytic HER activity. Unfortunately, materials prepared by lithium intercalation are unstable. The 1T forms of  MoS<sub>2</sub> and MoSe<sub>2</sub> prepared by solvothermal or hydrothermal methods are, however, quite stable and exhibit good photochemical activity for HER. The 1T forms are generally superior to the covalently linked 2H forms. The present study shows how  MoSe<sub>2</sub> and MoS<sub>2</sub>  in both 2H and 1T forms can be exploited for photochemical HER activity by appropriate chemical manipulation.</div></p>
